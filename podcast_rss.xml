      <title>Episode 1 - October 13th, 2025 | TikTok Anthology</title>
      <description>Over an hour of short form presentations, ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes, curated and rounded up for a distraction free listening experience.



Most are added based off the hook alone since I use this for myself to listen to later. Which means I don't necessarily support or condone everything said in this anthology.</description>
